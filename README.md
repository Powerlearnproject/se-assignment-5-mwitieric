Integrating Git with VS Code for Version Control
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) provides robust integration with Git, making it straightforward to manage version control directly from the editor. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to initialize a repository, make commits, and push changes to GitHub:

Initializing a Repository
Open VS Code:

Launch VS Code and open the folder or workspace where you want to initialize the Git repository.
Initialize Git Repository:

Open the Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P) and type Git: Initialize Repository.
Select the folder where you want to create the repository.
Making Commits
Stage Changes:

In the Source Control view (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + G), you'll see all the changes detected by Git.
Click on the + button next to each file or use Stage All Changes to stage all modifications.
Commit Changes:

Below the staged changes, enter a commit message in the text field.
Press Ctrl/Cmd + Enter or click the checkmark icon to commit the changes.
Pushing Changes to GitHub
Linking to a Remote Repository (GitHub):

If not already linked, in the Source Control view, click on Publish to GitHub or use the Remote section to add a remote repository.
Push Commits:

After committing your changes locally, click on the ... (more actions) next to your repository in the Source Control view.
Select Push to push your changes to the remote repository (GitHub).
You may need to authenticate with GitHub if it's your first time pushing.
Example Workflow
Let's assume you've made changes to a file named index.html:

Stage Changes:

Open index.html and make modifications.
Save the file.
Switch to VS Code, open the Source Control view (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + G), and stage your changes by clicking the + icon next to index.html.
Commit Changes:

Enter a commit message like "Updated index.html with new content".
Press Ctrl/Cmd + Enter to commit the changes.
Push Changes to GitHub:

Click on the ... in the Source Control view and select Push.
Authenticate with GitHub if prompted.
Your changes are now pushed to your GitHub repository.
